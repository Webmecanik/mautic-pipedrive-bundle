## Features settings

### Webhooks
The integration now supports webhooks from Pipedrive. To configure webhooks:

1. In your Mautic Pipedrive 2 plugin settings, set up webhook authentication:
   - Configure a Webhook username
   - Configure a Webhook password

2. These credentials will be used to authenticate webhook calls from Pipedrive to Mautic.

The webhook endpoint will be available at: `/pipedrive2/webhook`

### Features tab
Check your wished features.

If you want to have a full synchronisation (automated), you will need to enable special command in your CRONjob (see hereunder).

### Sync Behavior Notes
- Push/Pull operations can be individually disabled in the configuration
- Improved handling of multi-select fields and label synchronization
- Owner synchronization is now optional and can be enabled/disabled in settings

#### Commands

Run sync every 20 minutes

`php bin/console mautic:integrations:sync Pipedrive2 --start-datetime="-20 minutes"`

First time sync for data from last year

`php bin/console mautic:integrations:sync Pipedrive2 -f --start-datetime="-1 year"`

### Mapping tab
Map you contact ans company fields according to your data exchange expectations. Be sure to respect field format and field constraint values.

### Delete contacts reciprocity
By enabling this feature, deletion of contacts will be synchronized between systems. The synchronization happens through:
- Webhook (immediate) from Pipedrive
- Command sync delete from Mautic

**⚠️ Be extremely careful using this feature as deletions are permanent.**

### Sync. owners
You can enable the synchronisation of contacts and companies owners.

**⚠️ You need to have users (owners) existing in both applications using the same email address.**

### Sync. contact activities
You can send Mautic contact activities in Pipedrive contact history. Then your sales team is able to have an overview of the contact activities (form submission, page hits, emails open, etc.).

* In the feature tab, select the type of even you want to sync.
* **⚠️ You need to create all the custom activities you'll sync. from the plugin tab.** Go to Pipedrive > Settings > Company Settings > Activities > all activity events select in plugins settings. All activities types are matched by activity name (see hereunder).
* Start using your app!

# Requirements
This plugin needs the Company merge event merged in Mautic 5. You can cherrypick it from: https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/11748
It also needs Disable activity push from Mautic repository: https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/11255

# Troubleshooting
## First sync. can be taking all time contacts & companies?
Yes it can. See dedicated command above.

## Be sure to have strictly the same field value for constraint format
* In a number field you can have only numbers
* In a select field you should have the same list of values between the 2 apps

## Contact not synced?
1. Check your plugin feature tab, be sure to have checked the expected features
2. Check that your authentication is still working by entering again your credentials
3. If the user that authenticated the plugin doesn't have Mautic or Pipedrive access, the sync. will be interrupted according to the right loss.

## Owner sync. not working
Be sure to have the owner existing as users in both application with same email address. If the user is not existing, the user cannot be assigned as owner.

## Contact not deleted
Once you delete your contact or company in Mautic, it can take several minutes to be applied in Pipedrive, it is not instant deletion.
Same for deletion in Pipedrive, this could take few minutes.

## Mapping firstname and lastname
Following https://github.com/Webmecanik/mautic-pipedrive-bundle/issues/6, by default Pipedrive propose a Name field not distinguishing firstname and lastname. In consequence those fields are not available to mapping.
Ask your Pipedrive support to enable usage of this 2 separated fields first, and then you will find them in Mautic mapping. (confirmed on Pipedrive community forum https://community.pipedrive.com/discussion/comment/19741/#Comment_19741).
